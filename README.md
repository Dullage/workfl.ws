# workfl.ws

A web editor for [workfl](https://github.com/Dullage/workfl) (a lightweight markup language for simple workflow diagrams).

Link: <https://workfl.ws>

The editor uses [workfl](https://github.com/Dullage/workfl) to convert the user input to [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) syntax which is then rendered into a diagram SVG using the mermaid api.

## To Do

* Full syntax guide.
* Onboarding.
* Diagram Styling. Keep light and simple to match UI.
* Scrollbar styling (for long input).
* Handle large workflows (scrolling / panning?).
* Saving. Can the markup be stored in the URL similar to [itty.bitty.site](http://link.dullage.com/21a98)?
